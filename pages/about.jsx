        Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Md Anas Sabah, a software developer from India and a
        proud graduate of Chandigarh University. I love building sleek,
        scalable, and smart applications from pixel-perfect UIs to powerful
        backends and AI-driven agents that bring ideas to life.

        What started as a love for crafting seamless frontend experiences has
        grown into a journey of mastering the entire spectrum of software
        development. Over time, Iâ€™ve moved beyond just creating user interfaces
        to architecting complete systems that are scalable, efficient, and
        intelligent.

        Along the way, Iâ€™ve developed a strong passion for solving complex
        problems, whether itâ€™s designing modular backend architectures,
        optimizing performance for real-world use cases, or building AI-driven
        agents that push the boundaries of automation.

        One of my proudest milestones recently has been creating and publishing
        my own npm package, which in just a month has already been adopted by
        300+ developers worldwide. This achievement not only reflects my
        technical expertise but also my commitment to contributing back to the
        developer community.

        I believe that building software is not just about writing code, itâ€™s
        about creating meaningful impact. Each project I take on is an
        opportunity to merge creativity, logic, and innovation to deliver
        solutions that truly make a difference.

        Proficient across the stack, I build responsive UIs with React and
        Next.js (Tailwind CSS, Redux/Jotai), architect modular APIs with Node.js
        & Express (and FastAPI in Python), work with PostgreSQL & MongoDB, and
        implement real-time features using Socket.io. I also ship mobile/desktop
        apps with React Native & Electron, create AI agents with CrewAI and n8n,
        automate with ChatGPT APIs, and deploy using Docker on AWS/Firebase with
        a modern tooling setup (Vite, Webpack, Babel, Git, Postman, Figma)
